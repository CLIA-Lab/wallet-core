### Private Key
The private key is a number between 1 and $1158 \cdot 10^{77} - 1$ (exclusive). We generate it by applying the following
algorithm from *Mastering Bitcoin*:

1. A random string of 25 characters is generated by successively picking random characters from a fixed string. The character
is selected by applying the `Int()` function from the `crypto/rand` package.
2. SHA256 hash algorithm is applied to the string to obtain 32 bytes of data.
3. The bytes are taking as a big-endian representation of a number. If this number is greater than 1 and less than 
$1158 \cdot 10^{77} - 1$, then it's returned; otherwise, execution goes back to the step 1.
